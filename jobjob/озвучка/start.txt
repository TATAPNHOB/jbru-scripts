Phew! I feel more relaxed already.^Deborah, clear my calendar. It’s time to get to know our candidates!^Geez, all these numbers are stressful right? Let’s cool off with some icebreakers.^Is it just me or is this report BORING. Time for some more icebreakers!^Looks right to me, but I\'ll forward it to my buddies in accounting. Meanwhile, how about some more icebreakers.^You can\'t argue with the numbers. Believe me, I\'ve tried. No mouths! Let\'s do some more icebreakers.^Good effort, everyone. Let\'s regroup with some more icebreakers.^The biggest number\'s the best if you ask me. Anyway, let\'s try a couple more icebreakers.^Probably my fault; I don\'t know how to work email and I refuse to learn.^Probably my fault; my computer only opens MIDI files.^Probably my fault; (whisper) I used them to clean up a mess I made.^Probably my fault; I was reading them in a park and a big bird stole some pages.^Probably my fault; the chair that does my collating is out sick.^Probably my fault; a rat got in my desk drawer and everything in there is his now.^Probably my fault, I fed them to the office horse.^Probably my fault; I got jealous of all the other jobs you\'ve had, so I ripped them up.^Probably my fault; I tried to print them out, but Greg was printing his \"screenplay.\"^Probably my fault; I keep my most important files in the trash can and SOMEBODY stole them.^Probably my fault; I left them under my pillow so I could learn about you in my dreams.^Probably my fault; I always forget to empty my briefcase when I put it in the washing machine.^Probably my fault, I thought they were junk mail.^Probably my fault, I used them on my vision board.^Probably my fault, I can’t stop making confetti!!!^Probably my fault, the wolves, they come at night and take everything.^That’s it!^Interview complete!^That\'s all I needed!^I declare this interview over!^Hey we\'re done!^And that\'s it!^That\'s the last step!^All done!^You can also drag words around to rearrange them.^Okay, same as before. Respond any way you want, just don’t skimp on the details. Put some meat on those word bones!^Okay, you know the drill. You can answer however you want, but don\'t be stingy with the words.^Okay, just like before. Say anything you want, but be descriptive! The more you write, the less time I have to spend alone with my thoughts!^Okay, you know the routine. Write whatever you want, and don\'t be afraid to get descriptive. Paint me a word picture, dang it!^Okay, back to business. Answer the prompts with whatever comes to mind. Open up that word-hose and let \'er rip!^Remember you can use any word you see on your device in your answer. Try grabbing a word from the question itself! ^Our employees have to be able to engage in a little small talk. It’s my first rule of management.^If you\'re no good at chitchat, you\'re no good to me. That\'s my first rule of management.^You gotta get descriptive so I know I can rely on you for juicy office gossip. It\'s my first rule of management.^Over-sharing leads to over-caring. It\'s my first rule of management.^Everyone knows the more you talk, the smarter you are. It\'s my first rule of management.^Can’t find the right words for what you want to say?\n^Vote on your devices now.^Choose your favorite now.^Vote for your favorite now.^Cast your vote now.^Go ahead and vote already!^This time I want to know how you would handle some tough workplace scenarios. ^This has been the toughest decision I’ve ever avoided making.^You all did great, but one of you did greater...est.^Honestly I could see myself sharing a cup of toner in the break room with any of you, but we gotta pick one.^I wish I could hire you all, but the first rule of management is one employee per job.^The first rule of management is never fall in love, but one of you has stolen my heart...^I wish we had the budget to hire all of you... and still pay for my yearly bonus. But we don\'t.^You\'re all fine candidates. Except maybe you. Anyway, only one of you\'s getting hired.^This is my favorite part of being a manager. Other than being in charge all the time.^Great! Let’s put these in our filing system.^Okay! I\'ll just file these...^Alright, now we\'ll just file your answers...^Welcome to the team!^Great work! That’s what I’ll be saying every day to the ONE of you who gets the job. Let’s see who the frontrunner is…^That was a truly brilliant display. Let’s see who’s my current favorite!^I\'m not much for reading, but from what I skimmed you guys did great! Let\'s see who\'s in the lead...^Good job! And speaking of jobs, let\'s see who\'s most likely to get one...^You all did equally well! Just kidding, let\'s look at the scores.^A good manager knows that people are more than just numbers. Still, the numbers are the main thing so let\'s see \'em...^That took a lot of teamwork. Let\'s see who teamworked the best...^Well done! Let\'s see who\'s on their way to the top.^As the boss, I’ve got to be decisive. So I’m decisive-ing that you guys should pick.^These are both pretty great, but I like one of them better. I just need you guys to remind me which one.^Now this is a tough choice. And since choice-making is so valuable, why don\'t you guys show me you can do it.^I know one of these is better than the other, but as a test, why don\'t you guys choose.^Of course I could easily pick the best answer, but my business senses are telling me to make you guys do it.^Boy, if I were you I’d be real nervous now! How about one more icebreaker to keep things light?^Legally I have to tell you that none of this is binding until a contract is in place, blah blah blah, let\'s do one more icebreaker!^You know what would go down smooth right now? One more icebreaker.^Math, am I right? Let\'s do one more icebreaker.^I\'ll be sending you a short survey about this interview after we finish up. Feel free to be brutal, I don\'t read them. Now, how about one last icebreaker?^Welcome, potential hires! We’re thrilled you’ve applied for this exciting employment opportunity!^Tap any word you see to add it to your response.

Unfortunately, there’s a whole bunch of you... and only one job. It’s incredibly stressful. For me!^If you haven’t guessed, I’m the boss around here, but I like to think of myself more as a buddy! A boss buddy! Water?^Round two of questioning! ^I\'m gonna send some icebreaker questions to your device. Answer them any way you want. There are no rules! Except this ONE rule: you gotta use at least five words, okay? ^Okay!^Oh and Janet? You’re fired.^Oh and Stephanie? You\'re fired.^Oh and Louis? You\'re fired.^Oh and Allard?

Always set clear expectations. And I expect us to be best friends, so let\'s get started!^My first rule of management? Make sure your employees feel prepared. So prepare yourself for some questions happening right now. Let\'s go!^I haven’t tried it, but it probably works!^I sure wish I’d asked these questions to that stapler we had to let go...^Everything is words if you dream it!^It\'s almost like you\'re using my own words against me! Just like Linda...^I bet whoever came up with this is pretty cool! (whispers) It was me.^The only limit is your imagination! And also there\'s a time limit.^If you really fall in love with a word, tap it a whole bunch and use it again and again!^Now that I’ve put you all at ease, I’m sending my first round of hard-hitting interview questions to your device.^Now that we\'re all friends, I\'m sending my first incisive interview questions to your device.^Now that we\'re pals, I\'m sending some tough-but-fair interview questions to your device.^Someone’ll get that.^Don’t overthink it. Just put down whatever enters your mind.^Then say something different, pal, because that’s all you’re getting! The first rule of management is “limitations foster creativity.”\n^Then say something different I guess! The first rule of management is \"just make it work already.\"^Then quit complaining and say something else! The first rule of management is \"go with the flow.\"^In the words of my dad, this is your last chance to impress me, so make it count!^No pressure, but this is your last chance and there\'s a lot riding on it!^If you\'ve been holding back all your really impressive answers, now\'s the time to let \'em rip!^This is your last chance to wow me, and I LOVE being wowed.^Boy if someone asked me to define my entire life in one statement I would probably freak out and blow it! But I\'m sure you\'ll do fine.^If you need motivation, remember whoever gets the job gets to hang out with me all day, every day!^It\'s your last chance for a home run, so slam dunk it through the goal posts, champ!^And hey: Don\'t screw it up.^I don’t even need to read these to know they’re great.^Not what I would have written, but hey I already have a job!^Wow, I\'m learning a lot from these! Including things I legally shouldn\'t know!^Can I be honest? I feel like I\'m nailing this.^Looks like words to me!^I\'ve never read better submissions. Or any submissions.^This counts as your orientation by the way.^I like what I\'m seeing!^We don\'t recycle all this paper. Just the words.^This is exactly what I hoped each of you would say.^MUSIC/theme_plain^MUSIC/theme_stuttered^Stevens, we need some big thinkers. I’m talking BIG big. Ever hear of the iPhone? I want someone who’s got one of THOSE!^Yello? Of COURSE they know they can join the audience by going to Jackbox.tv and entering the room code on the screen. Who doesn\'t know that? Okay, love you too, mom.^Bubz here. We need more board members? No problem! Anyone watching can go to Jackbox.tv and enter the room code to join the board right now! Also I feel like this could have been an email.^Hey there! Yeah, I\'m doing it now. No, they\'re still writing. Haha, I know right?^Fumigation? Is that today? Well, I\'m in the middle of an interview, but go ahead and pump in the gas, they probably won\'t notice.^Stevens, gas up the private jet... Well, then get me a first class flight... Fine, just bring me a little bag of peanuts.^Stevens, find out how many caterpillars there are in Canada. Could be a real untapped market.^Lunch orders? Well, I don\'t know which one I\'m hiring yet, but bring in one really good meal and then I guess a bunch of tap water and croutons.^Stevens, somebody parked in my private spot. And even worse, they parked MY CAR there! Oh wait, nevermind.^Stevens, I want to apologize for those posts I wrote about you on the company portal. You didn\'t? Oh you should check them out, they are HILARIOUS.^An exciting business opportunity? You say there are MULTIPLE levels to this marketing? Count me in!^I\'m sorry, we\'re canceling our membership with your health club. We got a better offer from a fight club. Sure, I can tell you about it!^Sorry Greg, I have to cancel band practice tonight. These guys are really dragging out this interview...^Buckle up Stevens, it\'s going to be another all-nighter. I\'ll make the popcorn, you download more ghost stories off the internet!^Stevens, tell Spencer to come in early tomorrow. I\'m coming in late and I don\'t want to run into him.^Yes, the plaque should say \"BEST COWORKER EVER\" and underneath that \"AND ALSO FRIEND!\" And then under that put \"MAYBE BEST FRIENDS??\" with two question marks. Is that coming on too strong, plaque guy? Oh you\'re no help.^Hi, I was there yesterday for a detox and all they did was drain my jug and charge me 500 bucks! Ugh, yes I\'ll hold...^Maintenance, the lights in my office are doing that buzzing thing again. Oh no, wait, there\'s a bee in my desk. Carry on!^Bubz here. Eighty palates of expired fungal cream? At that price I can\'t afford NOT to buy!^Stevens, where is the private bidet I ordered? EW! That\'s what a bidet is?! Nevermind!^Stevens send everyone an email about how everyone is sending email wrong.^Jan! Did you watch last night\'s episode? Can you believe the chef poisoned the mayor\'s father? Well, if you don\'t want spoilers you shouldn\'t answer your phone!^Stevens, invest everyone\'s 401k money in branded ringtones. I have a good feeling...^Hey Ray, my computer\'s doing that thing where my waffles come out all soggy... Fine, \"toaster,\" whatever it\'s called, just fix it!^Ray, I was trying to buy shoes online and long story short there\'s a Dolley Madison silver dollar stuck in my floppy drive.^Hey Ray, I don\'t know if it\'s a network thing or something with the servers but I\'m lonely.^Stevens, I\'ve got a contact at the bank offering four quarters for one dollar! Get down there and buy \'em out!^Dr. Gremlik, I\'m still having that stress problem. My job is super important and yet I have ZERO stress! Anyway, have a good day!^Stevens, add another diet grape juice to my food diary. And do NOT mention that little chocolate from Paul\'s desk. I told you about that in confidence.^Yes sir! We all LOVE the motivational wall art the board picked out! It\'s much nicer than that boring old picture of my family! Right away sir, I\'ll tell them anyone can join the board by going to Jackbox.tv and entering the room code.^Yes ma\'m, we\'re all feeling VERY motivated by the posters the board sent along. I might even join the board myself by going to Jackbox.tv and entering the room code! I shouldn\'t? Okay then!^Stevens... I love you, good bye!^Okay Kevin, ready for some water cooler gossip? Sometimes, after a long work day, I put pop rocks in my tank just to take the edge off!^Hello? Yes, we’re out of paper. And before you ask, no it’s not because I photocopied myself dozens of times to see what the back of my head looks like!^Stevens, it’s time for an office treat! I just placed an order for a milkshake and everyone can have a sip!^Stevens, I can’t tell if it’s nerves or condensation, but I am REALLY excited about these applicants! Now bring me a towel.^Bob! Good news about that vacation you wanted. I got you a tiny desk fan and a screensaver that looks like the beach! Hello?^Stevens, I crunched some numbers and it looks like we’re losing a ton of money on this thing called ‘payroll.’ Get rid of it!^Dave, it’s Bubz again. Any word on getting that fancy laminating machine? Yes, I soaked through another stack of business cards...^Janice, I’m thinking of repainting the office. Should I go with eggshell or taupe? You’re right, eggshell is too flashy.^Stevens, I’ve heard music in the office boosts morale. Now I only have two CDs, so see if people prefer smooth jazz or Maroon 5.^Deborah, what does my Thursday look like? Sunny with a chance of business? I like it.^Stevens, I’m feeling a little salty today…yeah, I don’t think I’m using my neti pot correctly^Stevens, who’s been eating all my pudding? You know I can’t digest anything with corners!^Huge news, Stevens. I just learned that I’m the only one who can prevent forest fires. We’ve GOT to capitalize on this somehow!^(singing) Office stew, office stew, cook it in a pot! Office stew, office stew, stir it up! It’s a bowl full of staplers and binder clips and stuff! Office stew, office stew, office yum yum yum! --Were you recording that Stevens? Well why not?!^Hello? You want to talk to me about my car’s extended warranty? In this economy?^Stevens, has someone been microwaving fish in the break room? No? Well, why not?^You should see them, Jan. It’s just like The Notebook. No, not the movie. I drew a picture of people applying for a job in my notebook. Anyway, it’s like that.^Of course the job comes with benefits, Jan! They get to work with me! Oh, no, there’s no insurance or anything.^Miranda, I\'d like to boost morale. Let\'s treat everyone to lunch. Delivery? No, just open a can of tuna right on their desks. TUNA IS A TREAT, MIRANDA.^Hello? Yes sir! No, this isn’t IT, this is Bubz, sir. Uh… I guess I can help... you\'d like to be linked to the Board. Have you tried going to jackbox.tv? Try that. Ok. Now put in the room code. It\'s on the…on the screen, sir. No, down in the corner there. Ok. Good! Yes, you are good at technology, sir.^Mark? Have any of our lobbyists gotten to the Senator? Our lobbyist is the Senator? Mark, I’m starting to think neither of us know how politics works.^Stevens, I need you to call security ASAP. The creepiest looking guy I’ve ever seen just walked by and--oh, that’s your new haircut? Take the rest of the day off and fix it.^How many times do I need to say this, Stevens!? Only authorized personnel are allowed on the rooftop patio. And I’m not authorized! If I catch me up there again, you’re in a lot of trouble!^Stevens, am I allergic to gluten? Well I’m about to eat an entire baguette for lunch so you’ve got about five minutes to find out!^Hello? Board members can join the audience if they go to jackbox.tv and put in the room code? I already know that! Stop calling here!^Stevens, hold my calls. Love my calls. Cherish my calls...do what I could never do for my calls. They deserve that much. ^Note to self: Million dollar idea: Uber for other Ubers... Superuber... Soupber... Souper. Ok, it’s called Soup. End note! ^Spencer, I was just calling to check if you were still on hold with my cable provider like I asked but clearly you’ve decided that this phone call with me is more important than your job. Do better.^Deborah, get corporate on the phone. They have really catchy hold music and these interviews are STILL going.^Stevens, what’s this about needing a company wellness program? We already have a company well! What’s more relaxing than fetching a pail of water?^Yes? We have rats in our basement!? They’re hired! Tell the raccoon she’s been replaced!^Stevens, just calling to see if you received all those iTunes gift cards you asked for. Fraud? Hmm, lucky I used the corporate credit card...^Stevens, keep an eye on that washing machine in accounting. I suspect him of money laundering. Get it, Stevens? Hello?^Jan, take dictation. To the Airport… At around 1 o\'clock. No, Jan. Take Richard Tation, to the airport at one o\'clock. ^Hey, Cam, what’s the name of the new security guy? We don’t have security!? Then let’s just hire that guy, he’s got moxie.^MUSIC/credits^Fun, right?^Pretty innovative, right?^Genius, right?^Not bad, right?^In business we call that a curveball.^In business we call that the ol\' switcheroo.^Impressed yet?^Are you loving this as much as I am?^Unless you\'re thinking about spiders. Too scary!^Unless you\'re thinking about a big delicious sandwich! I skipped lunch and I am DYING over here.^Unless you’re thinking about my ex. We’re still very close, I just don’t want to hear about them right now, okay? This is my space!^Unless you\'re thinking about polka music. The workplace is no place for polka.^Unless you\'re thinking about a snorkel that\'s also a flashlight. That\'s MY idea!^Unless you\'re thinking about Oshkosh, Wisconsin. That place is dead to me...^Unless you\'re thinking about French Romantic literature. I\'m not caught up yet and I don\'t want any spoilers!^Unless you\'re thinking about parkour. It\'s like, \"Cool it with the jumping!\"^Unless you are thinking about everything you’ve ever said, and trying to not be paralyzed with regret!^Unless you\'re thinking about a nap in a comfy hammock.

I don\'t trust puppets.^Unless you\'re thinking about my landlord. My place has a LOT of water damage...^Unless you\'re thinking about collecting rare coins.

[EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^If you need the restroom... well, I need a vacation, but you don\'t hear me complaining. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Please don\'t steal our pens. They\'ve been through enough. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Shame you weren\'t here yesterday. We had a nacho bar. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I’m kind of having a tough day because I just found out that birds aren’t real. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^How am I? Just twerking for the freakend. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Keep your hands away from my buttons, I\'m on a break. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^If there\'s too many of you, some of you can be in the audience. I promise it\'s just as thrilling. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Can I get anyone anything? No, I cannot. Any other questions? [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Get busy jobbing or get busy dying, that\'s what I say. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Apparently Jackbox.tv is a website? Go there and enter the room code and stop staring at me. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^You didn\'t hear it from me, but Bob and Dennis are a thing now. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I read everybody\'s mail. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I have to stay late tonight because I\'m plugged into the wall. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^If you\'re not playing, you can join our esteemed board of directors in the audience by entering the room code at jackbox.tv. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I’d offer you some coffee but the pot’s out sick today. That daily grind will get to ya. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for second lunch. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Really looking forward to cardigan weather. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Anyone here single? Sorry, I meant got any singles? I gotta take the bus home today. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Did someone leave the cracker box open? That’s a penalty. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Do you say GIF? Or Jiff? I say Jeff. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Did you ask a question? I’m never listening. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Maybe I\'ll still get to see Paris... [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^If you\'re playing with kids, you might wanna check the Content Control section in the pause menu. As for me, this is as family-friendly as I get. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I\'m supposed to say you can change the settings from the pause menu now, without quitting the game. Welcome to the \'90s. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^If you\'re tired of all the boss\'s yapping, you can turn on Skip Tutorials in the pause menu. Just don\'t come crying to me when you\'re confused. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^You can turn down the volume for music, voice, and sound effects from the game\'s pause menu. It\'s not like people worked hard on those things or anything. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I picked a bad day to give up scrapbooking. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Somebody push me closer to the window. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Personally, I like Drawful. Now there\'s a game. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I\'m sneaking out early for a massage. Gotta get these kinks outta my cord. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I don\'t think we\'re a real company. Just FYI. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I wasn\'t always like this. I got cursed by a witch. My life is mostly the same. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^I don\'t care which of you gets hired, I\'m not validating anyone\'s parking. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^Yeah, I\'ve been around. I remember when these games maxed out at 8 players. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^No, I do not know Cookie. [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^(long sigh) [EventName=HOST/DummyFax]^No votes? Well that\'s boring.
